## Datasets
### AIFB
From <cite>[A Collection of Benchmark Datasets for Systematic Evaluations of Machine Learning on the Semantic Web \[1\]][1]</cite>:  The AIFB dataset describes the AIFB research institute (*KIT Institut f√ºr **A**ngewandte **I**nformatik und **F**ormale **B**eschreibungsverfahren*) in terms of its staff, research group, and publications. In <cite>[Kernel Methods for Mining Instance Data in Ontologies \[2\]][2]</cite> the dataset was first used to predict the affiliation (i.e., research group) for people in the dataset. The dataset contains 178 members of a research group, however the smallest group contains only 4 people, which is removed from the dataset, leaving 4 classes. Also, we remove the employs relation, which is the inverse of the affiliation relation.
